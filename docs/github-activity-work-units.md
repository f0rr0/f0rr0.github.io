# GitHub activity work units

Status: implementation contract for the current branch. Production cutover and
real-data acceptance are operational checks, not additional product modes.

## What the timeline represents

The timeline is a current projection of authored code work. It is not a raw
GitHub event log and it is not intended to reproduce GitHub's contribution or
authored-pull-request totals.

Code appears as one of three work units:

1. one current pull-request outcome;
2. one UTC day of direct work on a repository's canonical branch; or
3. one current outcome on an active non-canonical branch.

An opened issue is a separate authored milestone. Merge events, multi-parent
merge commits, empty commits, branch operations, tags, and obsolete PR/ref
memberships are not additional timeline rows.

The current result has these invariants:

- One eligible repository/SHA belongs to at most one work unit. The database
  enforces this with a unique membership constraint.
- A repository is rendered once per UTC day. Every work unit and opened issue
  for that repository and day is grouped under the same header.
- The displayed repository count is the number of rendered repository groups.
- A PR is one row. Merging it does not create a second row or a merge label.
- A force push changes current membership. A removed SHA no longer belongs to
  its old unit; the ownership and association rules are reevaluated from the
  current evidence.
- Facts publish without a summary. PR titles and commit messages are not
  fallback display copy.
- Known-private activity currently renders through the same path as public
  activity. Unknown visibility renders nothing.

A row shows aggregate owned commit count, unique filenames, additions,
deletions, detected languages, and a date range when the unit spans days. The
additions and deletions are authored churn summed across owned commits, not net
repository LOC. Language detection uses file extensions and excludes common
generated, vendored, lock, snapshot, minified, and binary-asset paths.

The work-kind icon is the only kind label in the row. A PR icon links to the PR;
a canonical-day or branch icon links to the newest owned commit. Issues retain
their authored titles because they do not use the code-summary pipeline.

## Eligibility boundary

A stored commit can enter the projection only when:

- GitHub's top-level author resolves to one of the tracked immutable user IDs;
- commit enrichment and the complete file ledger succeeded;
- GitHub's file cap was not reached;
- it has no more than one parent; and
- it has at least one file fact or non-zero churn.

The committer, pusher, webhook sender, PR author, and co-author trailers do not
replace commit authorship. Consequently, a PR authored by a tracked account is
not automatically a work unit: it must contain at least one current eligible
tracked-authored commit. This is why work-unit counts can differ from GitHub's
authored-PR count.

A logical change normally remains the exact repository ID plus commit SHA.
Messages and timestamps never infer aliases. One narrow exact-evidence rule
prevents rewritten work from stacking: when a merged PR member and another SHA
in the same repository have the same complete file-facts digest, and that SHA
is associated with the same merged PR, the merged PR owns that ref-reachable
landing once. Another pull request is never suppressed by patch
equivalence. A provider-verified merge SHA for a merged PR is also excluded from
canonical and side-ref ownership when it is absent from effective PR
membership. Both cases are reported as `merged_pr_landing` policy exclusions.
Associations alone do not establish landing identity.

## Deterministic ownership

The projector evaluates current complete evidence in this order:

| Priority | Evidence                                            | Owner                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1        | Member of an effective PR snapshot                  | Pull-request unit        |
| 2        | Verified merge landing without effective membership | Not published            |
| 3        | Reachable from the current canonical head           | Repository + UTC day     |
| 4        | Reachable from an active side head                  | Persisted branch lineage |
| 5        | No current complete owner                           | Not published            |

For an open PR, the effective snapshot is its current complete version. For a
closed or merged PR, it is its final complete version. When several effective
PRs contain the same change, selection is stable: merged before open before
closed, then tracked PR author before foreign PR author, then creation time and
PR node ID.

For side branches, the bytewise-normalized lexical ref order chooses the
primary current ref. The public identity uses its persisted lineage UUID, not
the branch name. Shared commits across several heads are still owned once.

Canonical-day identity is `repository ID + UTC activity day`. PR identity is
the immutable PR node ID. Branch identity is the lineage UUID. Work-unit member
order is a stable topological order with repository/SHA tie-breaks.

The activity timestamp is the latest owned commit's committer timestamp, with
the committed timestamp as fallback. For PR and branch units, an existing
activity anchor is reused when the normalized outcome digest is unchanged.
Repartitioning the same PR outcome therefore does not make old work look new.
Canonical-day units always follow their owned commits' UTC day.

## Completeness and privacy

Evidence and publication are separate. Durable evidence includes account event
checkpoints, webhook receipts, push observations, enriched commits,
commit-to-PR associations, PR versions and memberships, repository facts, and
desired head refs. Current ref generations store the tracked-author
intersection reachable from an exact head tip back to the account's configured
coverage boundary.

Publication uses only a mutually consistent snapshot:

- repository visibility must have been verified;
- the canonical branch must be known;
- commit-to-PR discovery must be complete before ref ownership is considered;
- every projection-relevant desired head in the repository must have a matching
  complete generation; and
- effective PR membership and every owned commit's file ledger must be
  complete.

If a desired ref tip changes before its new generation is complete, direct and
branch units for that repository fail closed on the next projection refresh.
The new generation atomically replaces the previous membership; partial
membership is never published.

Once verified, public, private, and internal repository facts remain usable
after an access change. An unverified repository is unknown and is omitted.
The current validation release does not redact known-private activity; that
policy belongs at the API boundary and does not alter capture, projection, or
summarization.

## Projection and feed storage

`github_work_units` is the current materialized projection.
`github_work_unit_memberships` stores its ordered, one-owner membership. A
projection refresh loads durable evidence, computes the full current result,
and swaps changed units and memberships under one advisory lock and repeatable
read transaction. It reads compact file counters and generated evidence digests
for the full corpus, then hydrates raw patches only for the bounded summary
batch.

`github_public_feed_head` is a singleton containing:

- `feed_revision` for initial-page work-unit changes, newly inserted
  known-visible issues, or an accepted summary becoming visible, hidden, or
  replaced;
- `ordering_revision` for ordered-set and membership changes;
- `head_content_revision` for the lightweight status endpoint;
- `last_published_at`; and
- `summarizing`;
- an internal projection-request token; and
- the last applied projection-and-summary pipeline policy digest.

Evidence writers replace the projection token in the same transaction as the
evidence change. A refresh clears only the token it observed and only after its
bounded summary-evaluation backlog is empty. A semantic policy change creates a
token until the affected corpus has been reevaluated. The combined policy digest
also makes ownership changes self-activating after a rolling deployment. Each
bounded refresh still publishes its current factual projection; historical
summary reevaluation does not hold factual changes back.

The public feed reads at most five UTC days per page in a read-only repeatable
read transaction. Pagination cursors are HMAC-signed and bound to the ordering
revision. An ordering change returns `409`, prompting a fresh first page.

The exact accepted summary is preferred. The newest accepted same-attribution
summary remains a visible fallback while an identity is refreshed. Accepted
output is also copied to durable storage without a work-unit foreign key, so a
projection deletion cannot erase it; an exact same-repository outcome may reuse
that prose after branch-lineage identity replacement.

## Outcome summaries

Summaries are optional prose for every known-visibility work unit. The summary
input contains normalized repository context and a complete file ledger. Patch
evidence is complete when it fits; oversized input is compacted by sampling
changed lines evenly across every file and composite change while retaining the
original counters. It does not contain PR titles, PR bodies, commit messages,
or provider event text.

The evidence shape depends on attribution:

- A tracked-authored PR whose complete membership is entirely eligible tracked
  work uses the PR's complete net diff.
- A PR containing collaborator work uses only the tracked author's owned commit
  diffs.
- Canonical-day work uses its ordered owned commit diffs.
- Branch work currently uses its ordered owned commit diffs because no branch
  comparison outcome is persisted.

JSON file lists can omit large text patches. Commit and PR acquisition recover
these from GitHub's raw diff using immutable commit/base/head SHAs, and validate
paths and line counts against the JSON ledger. PR acquisition also checks that
its base/head did not move during retrieval. Binary assets have no text patch;
their explicit binary entries describe an asset change without inventing contents.

An otherwise projected unit remains facts-only when its summary evidence has an
unrecoverable text patch, a counter mismatch, an incomplete or capped PR net
ledger, or an empty normalized outcome. It also remains facts-only when even
the compact file ledger and one changed-line sample per text file exceed the
hard input limit. Commit-level incomplete or capped ledgers are excluded at the
eligibility boundary. There is no generated fallback.

The provider is pinned to `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17`, with reasoning disabled,
low text verbosity, provider storage disabled, no SDK retry, a 32,000-token
input cap, and a 256-token output cap. Output is structured as a one-line
headline of at most 16 words and a standalone expanded summary of at most three
sentences and 80 words. Validation rejects invalid Unicode,
control/bidirectional characters, URLs, HTML, Markdown, and SHAs.

Summary identity includes the semantic policy, recipe, prompt, normalized
input, outcome digest, and attribution mode. Transport retries and storage
configuration do not invalidate prose. A five-minute debounce absorbs active
rewrites. Up to eight newest-first inputs are deterministically evaluated per
projection refresh. A separate bounded worker starts at most one provider claim.
Valid output remains cacheable if its input becomes stale while the request
runs. Exact current output is preferred, followed by the newest accepted
same-attribution output for the identity, then by an exact same-repository
branch outcome after lineage replacement. A force push with the same complete
outcome can therefore reuse accepted prose without inventing ownership or
changing the activity anchor.

Claims are ordered by newest activity, then newest observed content:

- each attempt may start at most twice;
- at most 100 requests may start per UTC day and 3,000 per UTC month.

These limits are application configuration; the database only records usage.
Started requests count even when they fail. A transient failure waits 15
minutes before its one possible retry. Output-format rejection uses that same
bounded retry; invalid persisted input and exhausted attempts become facts-only.
The last failure code is retained on the attempt. Superseded attempts that never started are removed;
a paid retryable attempt becomes a payload-free tombstone that retains its
request count. Its input is rebuilt and debounced only if the exact input becomes
current again. Expired leases are recovered by the next worker.

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is optional; without it the factual pipeline continues and no
summary claim is started. This is not an OpenAI free-tier design. At the
[model's documented price](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4-nano)
of $0.20/M input tokens and $1.25/M output tokens, the hard monthly maximum is
`3,000 * (32,000 * $0.20/M + 160 * $1.25/M) = $19.80`.

## Intake and cadence

Three inputs converge on the same durable worker queues:

- `POST /api/github/webhook` verifies the HMAC and delivery ID, then stores
  supported push/head, pull-request, and opened-issue signals. It performs no
  GitHub fetch and no model call.
- Authenticated Events polling reads at most three 100-event pages per account,
  uses GitHub's ETag and poll interval, and commits evidence with its checkpoint.
- Head reconciliation walks each active account's current repository inventory
  in persisted batches of at most eight API pages and eight repositories per
  account. A complete inventory is refreshed daily; an incomplete or failed
  refresh may resume after 15 minutes, and explicit backfills may force it.

Supabase Cron invokes:

| Route                      | Schedule                              | Bound                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/cron/github-sync`    | every 5 minutes                       | 15-second request                                                    |
| `/api/cron/github-worker`  | every 5 minutes, offset by 2 minutes  | 60-second request; default eight items per factual queue and one ref |
| `/api/cron/github-summary` | every minute                          | 60-second request; at most one provider claim                        |
| `/api/cron/github-refs`    | every 15 minutes, offset by 4 minutes | 15-second request; eight ref pages/repositories per account          |

The worker processes factual queues and current-ref repair before recomputing
the projection and reconciling the minimal summary status. The separate summary
worker may claim one provider request, with newer work staying ahead of older
backlog. Webhooks shorten discovery, but they do not render a page directly;
publication still waits for the bounded factual worker.
Timeline payloads are read from the current projection and are never held in a
shared response cache.

## Historical backfill

The manual backfill accepts an inclusive UTC range of at most 31 days and a
cooperative processing budget of at most 30 minutes; the Action has a 35-minute
hard timeout. Broad runs must begin within the last 62 days; older runs require
a numeric repository ID.

The backfill:

1. verifies each requested token's immutable GitHub user ID;
2. loads each requested account's complete repository inventory;
3. lowers, but never raises, each requested account's ref coverage boundary;
4. performs one global repair pass over projection-relevant current heads;
5. enumerates PRs authored by each requested account that were updated since the lower
   bound, then keeps only PRs with a tracked-authored commit in the requested
   window;
6. drains only the scoped factual queues without projecting after every batch;
   and
7. refreshes the projection once when the scoped factual backlog reaches zero.

Routine due or leased reconciliation for an otherwise complete open PR is not
factual backlog. Missing current membership, required PR diff facts, unresolved
merged-PR identity, or a reconciliation error remains blocking and is reported
explicitly.

The command does not generate summaries and does not wait in process for a
durably deferred provider claim. It exits non-zero with a structured stop
reason when the deadline, provider retry, or remaining backlog prevents
completion. Re-running the same range is idempotent.

The current-ref ledger is complete only back to the earliest applied coverage
boundary. GitHub objects removed before any webhook, Event, PR scan, backfill,
or surviving current ref exposed them cannot be reconstructed.

## Known coverage boundary

A fresh ref baseline marks the canonical head projection-relevant without
expanding every pre-existing side head. Side-branch work becomes representable
when a later head creation or movement, a head webhook, or corresponding
push/Event plus current-ref evidence promotes that head; complete current PR
membership can represent the same authored work as a PR independently. An
unchanged pre-existing side branch with no surviving signal is not exhaustively
discovered on cold start.

Head webhooks are applied in delivery order; they are not an authoritative
ordering oracle. A delayed delivery can therefore leave a stale desired tip
until the bounded current-ref scan reads GitHub's present state. The ref route
runs every 15 minutes and is the authoritative reconciliation path; a heavily
paginated inventory can require more than one invocation.

## Minimal live state

The status endpoint returns the feed revision, a monotone head revision, last
feed publication time, and one boolean: whether the configured summary pipeline
has a current public evaluation, queued input, retry, or provider lease on the
initial five-day page. The next worker reconciliation clears an expired
abandoned lease. The UI renders only:

- `Shaping the latest update` while that boolean is true;
- `Updated … ago` (or `Activity is up to date`) otherwise; or
- `Show latest work` when a newer feed revision is observed, changing to
  `Showing latest work…` only while that refresh is pending.

Polling runs while the tab is visible, the browser is online, no refresh is
pending, and the timeline is in view when the browser supports intersection
observation. A settled page checks every five minutes at most three times.
While shaping summary work, it checks every three minutes, subject to a total cap
of 12 requests. The private, revalidated endpoint supports ETags; polling budgets
reset after a successful feed refresh. New content is never inserted while the
reader is moving through the page; the reader chooses `Show latest work` to
refresh.

## Verification and tests

`bun run github:verify --since <UTC> --until <UTC> [--repository <id|name>]`
builds a deterministic, read-only crosswalk for a half-open interval. It emits
stable IDs and counts for tracked candidates, eligible changes, integration
merges, ineligible changes, PR/canonical/branch units, owned changes, visibility
gaps, commit-enrichment backlog, authored PRs without a current owned member,
verified-landing ref-ownership violations, and each coverage or policy-exclusion
reason. Any enrichment backlog or verified landing in a canonical/branch unit
fails the crosswalk. `merged_pr_landing` and
`no_current_owner` are policy exclusions; unknown canonical branch, incomplete
head generation, incomplete PR coverage, and unknown visibility are coverage
gaps that fail the crosswalk.

The verifier reports the DB/projector crosswalk for already-ingested evidence.
It does not query GitHub and therefore cannot independently prove ingestion
completeness. Acceptance against real data must first run the relevant backfill
and then compare selected PRs, refs, and weeks/months with GitHub itself.

Behavioral tests cover these contracts rather than source strings or rendered
class names:
